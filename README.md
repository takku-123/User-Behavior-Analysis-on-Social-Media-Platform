## Key Sections

### 1. **Introduction**
Company Z, a social media platform, has seen rapid growth in terms of user base but lacks an in-depth understanding of user behavior on the platform. By better understanding user engagement and preferences, Company Z aims to improve user retention and unlock new opportunities for growth.

This report aims to solve this challenge by:
- Analyzing user behavior through detailed data exploration.
- Conducting cluster analysis to identify distinct groups within the user base.
- Developing a predictive model to forecast user behaviors and inform strategic decisions.

### 2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

#### 2.1 **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains data from 2,307 users, with 13 variables capturing user activity, including:
- **InDegree**: Number of users interacting with a given user.
- **OutDegree**: Number of users a given user interacts with.
- **TotalPosts**: Total number of posts made by a user.
- **LikeRate**: Average likes per post.
- **AccountAge**: Age of the account in days.
